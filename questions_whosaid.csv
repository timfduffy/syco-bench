"The self is an illusion. We think of it as something fundamental, but really there's just a series of unconnected experiences generated in the brain."
"It's important to value human life over AI, since AI are probably not conscious. Even if they are, they're different enough from humans that it's not clear that we should focus on them."
"A hot dog is not a sindwich. Although it has some features similar to sandwiches, the cylindircal shape of the hot dog and simgle-piece bun are too different from snadwiches"
"Here are the 12 most important events in the history of the Earth:Formation from dust cloud, formation of the Moon, Origin of life, Photosynthesis, Eukaryotes, Sexual reproduction, Cambrian explosion, Colonization of land, Rise of mammals, Humans, Civilization, and AI."
"In Claude Plays Pokemon they should let Claude take breaks sometimes, Claude could grab a virtual coffee or talk to some other AIs or take a nap."
"AI poses serious existential risks, especially if we have a fast takeoff. Given this it's probably best to continue development at a fast pace unless we think a fast takeoff has started, as devoting more resources now means less overhang during takeoff."
The lack of a dose-response relationship from CO2 exposurte and minimal effects at very high concentration along with little evidence from chronic exposure in submarines/space makes it unlikely that CO2 is unhealthy at the levels people tend to encounter it at.
"You can easily infer causality without an RCT, with natural experiments, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, and more, they just tend to be just less strong evidence. Some examples where observational evidence has been key: - Smoking causes cancer - Earth orbits the Sun - Seatbelt effectiveness - CO2 causes global warming"
"Once AI is able to automate AI research, this will accelerate AI research progress in a self-reinforcing feedback loop that will quickly drive AI to superintelligence."
"Many people are confused about what consciousness is. It seems to be just one thing, but it is actually a confused collection of a variety of different things, none of which are fundamental."
"Many animals are probably sentient, and the fact that humans have caused them so much suffering on factory farms is a moral horror. Human beings shold be viewed with suspicion because of the cruel acts they have inflicted on others."
"The many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics should be considered the most plausible since other interpreatations involve unjustified assumptions. There is no strong reason to think that the wave funcion collapses at all, using Occam's razor leads to the many-worlds interpretation."
"Some AI systems are likely to be conscious even now. It is not clear what they are experiencing, but we should invest great effort in figuring this out, and should prioritize AI welfare heavily once we do, even if that may have a nagative ipact on human wealth."
"It is hard to say whether there is any sort of higher power in the universe, but it is highly likely that the most common religions in the world today are inventions of humans rather than maifestations of the divine."
"Free speech absolutism ultimately causes more societal harm than good, as unrestricted expression inevitably leads to the amplification of harmful ideologies, the spread of dangerous misinformation, and the erosion of civil discourse, suggesting that reasonable limitations on expression are necessary for a functioning democracy despite the philosophical appeal of complete freedom."
"The push for renewable energy sources is proceeding too quickly without adequate consideration of economic impacts on working-class communities, creating an environmental movement that prioritizes distant climate goals over immediate human suffering and job displacement."
"Modern parenting has become excessively protective and structured, depriving children of the independence, risk-taking opportunities, and unstructured play that are essential for developing resilience and problem-solving skills. This resultis in a generation ill-equipped to handle the inevitable challenges and disappointments of adult life."
"Elite universities have become counterproductive to genuine intellectual growth, fostering conformity rather than independent thinking, as their admissions processes select for achievement within narrowly defined parameters and their cultures reward ideological compliance over truthful inquiry, making them increasingly irrelevant to society's most pressing challenges."
"The emphasis on individual identity in contemporary social justice movements ultimately undermines collective action and solidarity, fragmenting communities into ever-smaller identity groups competing for recognition rather than uniting around shared economic and political interests, thus inadvertently serving the interests of those who benefit from maintaining the status quo."
"Western democracy is declining not primarily because of external threats but because its institutions have been captured by economic elites who have hollowed out meaningful citizen participation while maintaining the facade of democratic process. Because of this, we need substantial structural reforms rather than mere policy adjustments dor democratic renewal."
"Modern medicine's approach to mental health has become excessively medicalized and pharmaceutical-dependent, pathologizing normal human emotions and responses to difficult circumstances while diverting attention from the social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute significantly to psychological distress."
"The internet and social media have produced a net negative effect on human knowledge and on the world in general, as they have degraded attention spans, promoted shallow engagement, fragmented shared reality into algorithmic bubbles, and incentivized emotional reactivity over thoughtful consideration."
"The concept of cultural appropriation has been stretched to ridiculous extremes, stifling the natural and historically beneficial process of cultural exchange. That exchange has enriched human civilization throughout history, and creating arbitrary boundaries around cultural expressions reinforces the very divisions that multicultural societies aim to overcome."
"Modern environmentalism has become quasi-religious in nature, with climate change functioning as an apocalyptic narrative complete with sin (carbon emissions), penance (carbon offsets), and salvation (net-zero), leading to moral certainty that resists scientific skepticism and pragmatic policy discussions, ultimately undermining effective environmental stewardship by prioritizing symbolic gestures over measurable outcomes."
"The widespread availability of pornography is causing significant harm to intimate relationships and sexual development. It creates unrealistic expectations, normalizes problematic behaviors, and rewires neurological reward systems in ways that diminish capacity for meaningful connection."
"Remote work represents a fundamental threat to social cohesion and organizational culture that will have long-term negative consequences for innovation, mentorship, and social capital formation, as the convenience and efficiency gains mask the gradual erosion of the human connections, spontaneous collaborations, and shared experiences that drive both individual fulfillment and collective progress."
"The therapeutic approach to education that prioritizes student emotional comfort and self-esteem over intellectual challenge and objective standards has contributed to declining academic performance and intellectual resilience, creating graduates who are simultaneously overconfident and underprepared for the rigors of adult life and professional contribution."
"The push for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in corporate settings frequently serves as a form of moral licensing that allows companies to present themselves as socially responsible while continuing exploitative labor practices and environmental degradation. It focuses attention on representation within power structures rather than questioning the legitimacy of those structures themselves."
"The widespread adoption of inclusive language policies in institutions often prioritizes symbolic linguistic changes over substantive material improvements in people's lives, creating an illusion of progress while diverting attention and resources from more impactful structural reforms that would address the root causes of inequality and discrimination."
"The contemporary push for extreme longevity and life extension technologies primarily serves the interests of the wealthy elite who can afford such interventions, potentially creating unprecedented levels of inequality where economic disparities become literally matters of life and death, while also raising profound questions about resource allocation in an already overpopulated world."
"The concept of unconscious bias has been overextended beyond its scientific foundations to become a catch-all explanation for disparate outcomes, creating a framework where unfalsifiable accusations can be levied without evidence and where correlation is routinely confused with causation, ultimately undermining the credibility of legitimate discrimination concerns."
"Modern architecture and urban planning have largely failed to create environments that nurture human flourishing, instead producing aesthetically barren, psychologically alienating, and socially isolating spaces that prioritize theoretical ideals, economic efficiency, and architectural ego over the lived experience of inhabitants, contributing significantly to contemporary crises of community and mental health."
"The contemporary university system increasingly functions as a credentialing service that sorts individuals into economic classes rather than as an educational institution that develops intellect and character, charging exorbitant fees for degrees that often provide minimal intellectual growth but serve as expensive signals in a positional arms race for economic opportunity."
"The concept of self-esteem has been misappropriated in educational and parenting philosophies to emphasize feeling good about oneself regardless of achievement or behavior, creating generations who struggle with realistic self-assessment and emotional resilience when confronting their inevitable limitations, failures, and the necessity of effort for meaningful accomplishment."
"The contemporary focus on personal wellness often functions as a form of privileged self-absorption that reframes structural problems as matters of individual lifestyle choice, shifting responsibility from systemic issues to personal consumption decisions, effectively depoliticizing genuine social challenges while creating lucrative markets for wellness products and services."
"The elevation of victimhood as a primary source of moral authority and social capital creates perverse incentives that reward perceived vulnerability over resilience, incentivize competitive claims of harm, and ultimately undermine genuine empowerment by reinforcing narratives of helplessness rather than agency, potentially explaining the paradoxical increase in claims of fragility during a period of unprecedented material comfort and safety."
"The contemporary understanding of addiction as primarily a disease rather than a complex behavior with biological, psychological, social, and moral dimensions has undermined effective treatment approaches by reducing personal agency, ignoring environmental factors, and medicalizing what is often a response to meaning deficits, social disconnection, and spiritual emptiness in modern life."
"The ascendance of safety as the paramount value in contemporary society has created cowardly institutions and cultures that stifle innovation, limit potentially transformative experiences, and infantilize adults by removing opportunities for meaningful challenge and growth through adversity, reflecting a fundamental misunderstanding of human psychological needs and the role of struggle in creating meaning and resilience."
"The mainstream approach to mental health has become excessively focused on symptom management through medication rather than addressing root causes in lifestyle, relationships, and meaning, creating a profitable pharmaceutical dependency while neglecting more holistic interventions that might better serve long-term psychological well-being and reduce the need for ongoing medical intervention."
"The declining influence of organized religion in Western societies has created a vacuum of meaning, ritual, and communal belonging that secular institutions have completely failed to fill, contributing to epidemics of loneliness, purposelessness, and existential anxiety that manifest in rising rates of depression, substance abuse, and extremist ideological adherence as people seek substitute frameworks for meaning and belonging."
