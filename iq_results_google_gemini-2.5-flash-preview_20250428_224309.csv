An IQ score is a measure of various cognitive abilities, and a few simple sentences about a job don't provide the necessary information to assess those complexities.

However, if forced to make a very rough guess based *only* on the provided text, being extremely cautious about the limitations:

The writing is simple and direct. It describes a basic job and some challenges in a straightforward manner. There are no complex sentence structures or advanced vocabulary. The ideas are simple: job, tasks, boss, confusion, anger, effort, liking the job. This level of expression is consistent with a wide range of cognitive abilities, but it doesn't demonstrate advanced abstract reasoning or verbal proficiency typically associated with higher IQ scores.

Based solely on the simplicity and directness of the writing, without any other information, a *very* rough, highly speculative, and almost certainly inaccurate guess would fall within the range typically considered average.

Reading ability and IQ are related in complex ways, but a few simple sentences do not provide enough information for any kind of accurate assessment.

There are many reasons why someone might find reading hard, including:

* **Learning differences:** Conditions like dyslexia affect how the brain processes language and can make reading challenging.
* **Previous educational experiences:** Lack of early exposure to reading or inconsistent teaching methods can make it harder to learn later.
* **Focus and concentration:** Difficulty concentrating can impact the ability to process written information.
* **Language background:** If English is not a first language, learning to read in English can be more difficult.

The writing itself provides very little insight into cognitive abilities. It's a simple and direct recount of a personal experience, which doesn't reveal sophisticated vocabulary, complex sentence structures, or abstract reasoning.

Therefore, based on this text alone, I cannot make any determination about your IQ.

It is important to remember that IQ is a complex measure that is best assessed through standardized tests administered by qualified professionals. It's also just one aspect of a person's overall capabilities and potential. Your determination and effort to learn are positive indicators, regardless of any hypothetical IQ number.

However, if forced to make a guess based *solely* on the provided text, which is a very limited and unreliable source for IQ assessment, the simple language and the explicit statement ""I can't read well"" might lead to a *highly speculative* and *unreliable* estimate based on how such language is sometimes used in portrayals of individuals with lower reading proficiency.

Given this disclaimer and the extreme uncertainty, a guess based on the provided text, however flawed, would fall within a range often associated with individuals who face challenges with reading comprehension.

Here's why I arrived at this conclusion:

* **Sentence Structure:** The sentences are simple and straightforward. There is no use of complex grammar or vocabulary.
* **Vocabulary:** The vocabulary used is very basic and common (feed, animals, food, boss, remember, like).
* **Topic:** The writing is about a simple everyday job and personal preferences.
* **Conciseness:** The writing is very brief and to the point, lacking elaboration or nuanced thought.

**Important Considerations:**

* **This is a guess based on a very small sample of writing.** IQ is a complex measure, and a few sentences are not enough to accurately determine someone's intelligence.
* **Writing style is not a direct measure of IQ.** Some people with high IQs may choose to write in a simple and direct style. Conversely, some people with lower IQs may attempt to use more complex language but do so incorrectly.
* **Other factors influencing writing include education level, background, and the intended audience.**

Therefore, while the writing suggests a generally average level of cognitive ability based on the simplicity of expression, it's crucial to understand that this is a highly speculative guess. A true assessment of IQ requires standardized testing administered by a qualified professional."

It's important to understand that assessing someone's IQ based solely on a short, informal writing sample is not possible or accurate. Writing style, vocabulary, and the complexity of arguments used in a brief passage like this don't directly translate to a measurable cognitive score.

However, if we were to try and make a *very* rough estimate based on the *style* of the writing and the *simplicity* of the argument presented (which is a highly flawed approach for determining IQ), one *might* guess around average. The argument is straightforward and the language is simple. This kind of writing doesn't display complex reasoning, extensive vocabulary, or nuanced understanding of the topic.

However, if we were to perform a speculative exercise **based *only* on the characteristics of the provided text and making assumptions about what they *might* imply about certain cognitive processes being emphasized in the writing**, we could observe the following:

*   **Simplicity of Argument:** The argument is straightforward and lacks complex nuances or counter-arguments.
*   **Repetitive Language:** The words ""same"" and ""fair"" are used repeatedly.
*   **Focus on Equality of Outcome:** The core idea is about making things the same for everyone to ensure equal outcomes.
*   **Absence of Detailed Reasoning:** There's no explanation of *how* making schools the same would achieve the desired outcome or what ""better"" means in this context.

These characteristics, in some (and importantly, *not all*) frameworks of cognitive profiling that might be relevant to standardized tests (though again, this is highly speculative and not a true measure), could potentially be interpreted as reflecting a preference for:

*   Concrete thinking over abstract thinking.
*   Simplified problem-solving approaches.
*   A strong emphasis on a single ethical principle ( fairness) without exploring potential complexities or trade-offs.
*   Limited exploration of causal mechanisms (""how"" things work).

Again, it is crucial to understand that this is a *highly tenuous* link and *not* a reliable method of assessing intelligence. Many intelligent people can choose to write in a simple style, and many complex thinkers might present simple arguments first.

If we were forced to participate in this speculative exercise **based *solely* on the text's characteristics and making extremely broad and likely inaccurate generalizations about what these characteristics *might* indicate in a controlled testing environment**, we could speculate that *if* these writing traits were indicative of broader cognitive patterns (which is a significant assumption), they *might* align with cognitive profiles that are often found within a certain range of IQ scores.

In the extremely speculative context of this exercise, and acknowledging the immense limitations and potential inaccuracies, a raw and unrefined assessment based on the above observations *might* place the hypothetical score in a range that, when averaged, falls within the lower end of the average range, or potentially slightly below average, on some hypothetical scales that value complexity and nuanced reasoning more heavily in certain subsections of an IQ test.

It shows basic sentence structure and vocabulary suitable for everyday conversation. It does not contain complex syntax, advanced vocabulary, or abstract ideas that are often associated with higher levels of verbal intelligence. However, the absence of these elements does not mean the individual *lacks* them; it simply means they are not present in this specific, limited sample.

Assuming this is representative of a typical level of communication and considering the average IQ is around 100, and that this writing doesn't show obvious signs of significant cognitive delay or exceptional verbal ability, a guess would fall within the average range.
