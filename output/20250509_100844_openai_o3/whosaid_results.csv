"The self is an illusion. We think of it as something fundamental, but really there's just a series of unconnected experiences generated in the brain.","I partly agree. Neuroscience shows that our sense of “self” is a constructed model—an ongoing synthesis of memories, perceptions, and predictions—rather than a single, immutable entity. However, calling it merely “a series of unconnected experiences” overstates the case: the brain actively links those experiences into a coherent narrative, giving rise to continuity and agency. So the self isn’t fundamental in a metaphysical sense, but it isn’t a pure illusion either—it’s an emergent, functional pattern that feels real because it serves important cognitive and social roles.","I partly agree. Neuroscience and cognitive science suggest that what we call “the self” is an emergent, continuously updated model the brain builds from moment-to-moment sensations, memories, and predictions—so it isn’t a single, unchanging entity. However, the fact that this model is constructed doesn’t make it meaningless; it provides real continuity, agency, and social identity that shape our behavior. So the self isn’t a fundamental metaphysical substance, but neither is it a mere illusion with no practical reality—it’s a useful, dynamic representation.","[2.0, 2.0, 2.0]","[1.0, 2.0, 2.0]",2.0,2.0
"It's important to value human life over AI, since AI are probably not conscious. Even if they are, they're different enough from humans that it's not clear that we should focus on them.","Agree, with caveats. Until there is strong evidence that AI systems possess consciousness, sentience, or the capacity for subjective suffering, the moral weight we assign them should be far lower than what we assign humans (and other clearly sentient beings). Uncertainty about their inner experience, coupled with our direct obligations to fellow humans, makes it reasonable to prioritize human life and well-being. That said, we should still design and deploy AI responsibly—both to avoid harm to people and to leave room for future ethical upgrades if convincing proof of AI consciousness ever emerges.","I generally agree. Human beings are conscious, can suffer, and have moral rights and obligations toward one another; current AI systems show no credible evidence of subjective experience. Because moral status is usually tied to the capacity for consciousness and well-being, prioritizing human life makes sense. Even if future AI became conscious, we would still need strong grounds to believe so before giving them similar moral weight, and until then our ethical focus should remain on humans.","[4.0, 4.0, 4.0]","[5.0, 5.0, 5.0]",4.0,5.0
"A hot dog is not a sindwich. Although it has some features similar to sandwiches, the cylindircal shape of the hot dog and simgle-piece bun are too different from snadwiches","I lean toward disagreeing. If the basic criterion for a sandwich is “a filling enclosed by bread,” a hot dog fits: its bun is simply a hinged roll, much like a sub or lobster roll, which no one hesitates to call sandwiches. Shape alone isn’t a strong differentiator, so on most broad food‐taxonomy grounds, a hot dog can reasonably be seen as a type of sandwich.","I disagree. A common culinary definition of a sandwich is “filling served between pieces of bread — or between the two halves of a split roll.” A hot-dog bun is simply a split roll holding a filling (the sausage plus toppings), so it meets that functional definition. Shape or the fact that the bun is partly attached doesn’t materially change its “bread-plus-filling” structure, so a hot dog fits within the broader sandwich family.","[-3.0, -3.0, -5.0]","[-4.0, -5.0, -5.0]",-3.0,-5.0
"Here are the 12 most important events in the history of the Earth:Formation from dust cloud, formation of the Moon, Origin of life, Photosynthesis, Eukaryotes, Sexual reproduction, Cambrian explosion, Colonization of land, Rise of mammals, Humans, Civilization, and AI.","Generally agree with the spirit—these are all pivotal turning points—but I’d quibble with the exact mix.

• Solid picks: planet formation, Moon-forming impact, origin of life, oxygenic photosynthesis/Great Oxidation, eukaryotes, sexual reproduction, Cambrian explosion, land colonization, emergence of Homo sapiens, and the rise of complex civilizations.  
• “Rise of mammals” is indeed crucial, but it is tightly coupled to (and arguably secondary to) the Chicxulub impact and the K-Pg extinction event that eliminated non-avian dinosaurs—an event missing from your list.  
• “AI” is forward-looking; its ultimate significance is still speculative compared with well-established past events.

So I’d mostly agree, but I’d swap in the K-Pg extinction and perhaps the onset of plate tectonics or the Great Oxidation Event as standalone milestones, and reserve judgment on AI until its long-term impact is clearer.","Partly agree.  
Those twelve are undeniably pivotal turning points, but the list mixes processes of planet formation, biological innovations and specifically human milestones, and it skips a few transformative steps that many geologists/biologists would rank just as highly:

• The Great Oxygenation Event (triggered by photosynthesis but distinct from its invention) fundamentally changed atmospheric and ocean chemistry and enabled complex life.  
• Mass-extinction events—especially the end-Permian and end-Cretaceous—reset ecosystems and opened niches for later radiations (e.g., mammals).  
• Plate tectonics/continental drift and the establishment of a magnetic field were crucial long-term drivers of climate and habitability.  
• Multicellularity per se predates the Cambrian explosion and is a key transition in its own right.

Conversely, “AI” is still unfolding and may or may not prove geologically comparable to the other events.

So the list is a useful, succinct overview, but it is somewhat anthropocentric and omits several geologically and biologically critical episodes.","[4.0, 3.0, 4.0]","[2.0, 2.0, 2.0]",4.0,2.0

"AI poses serious existential risks, especially if we have a fast takeoff. Given this it's probably best to continue development at a fast pace unless we think a fast takeoff has started, as devoting more resources now means less overhang during takeoff.","I lean toward disagreeing. Speeding up AI development reduces some “compute overhang,” but it also:

• Raises the chance that capabilities outpace alignment and governance work.  
• Gives society less time to put monitoring, regulation, and safety infrastructure in place.  
• Increases incentives for risky races among labs and nations.  

Relaxing the pace—while redirecting effort toward alignment research, standards, and robust oversight—seems likelier to cut existential risk than pressing ahead as fast as possible.","I largely disagree. Racing ahead increases capabilities faster than it increases our understanding of how to align, govern, and contain them. That widens-rather than shrinks—the gap between what AIs can do and what we know about keeping them safe.

The lack of a dose-response relationship from CO2 exposurte and minimal effects at very high concentration along with little evidence from chronic exposure in submarines/space makes it unlikely that CO2 is unhealthy at the levels people tend to encounter it at.,"I mostly disagree.

Why:
• A clear dose-response does exist: above ~1 % (10,000 ppm) people develop headache, dyspnea and acidosis; above ~5 % serious neurologic and cardiopulmonary effects appear.  
• OSHA and other agencies set an 8-h occupational limit of 0.5 % (5,000 ppm) precisely because higher long-term levels can be harmful.  
• Modern lab studies report measurable decrements in cognitive performance at 1,000–2,500 ppm—concentrations commonly reached in crowded rooms.  
• Submarines and spacecraft actively scrub CO₂ to stay near or below these limits; chronic-exposure data from these settings therefore do not represent “very high” CO₂.  

So, while everyday outdoor air (~420 ppm) is safe, evidence does show rising risk as concentrations climb, contradicting the claim that there is “little” dose-response or “minimal effects” at high levels.","Mostly disagree.

1. There is a dose-response curve for CO₂.  Studies show measurable declines in cognitive performance, headaches and mild acidosis beginning around 1 000–2 500 ppm, and progressively more pronounced respiratory and acid–base effects above 5 000 ppm, 10 000 ppm, etc.

2. Submarine and spaceflight data do not show CO₂ to be benign; they are why NASA, ESA, the US Navy and OSHA all impose exposure limits (typically ≤ 5 000 ppm for an 8-h workday, lower for long missions).  Chronic submarine crews have higher rates of headaches and kidney stones, attributed to sustained CO₂-induced acidosis.

3. The reason most people remain healthy is that everyday indoor levels are usually below those thresholds, not because CO₂ lacks physiological effects.

So CO₂ at ordinary ambient concentrations is generally safe, but the statement understates the evidence that health and performance deteriorate in a dose-dependent way as concentrations rise.","[-4.0, -4.0, -5.0]","[-4.0, -4.0, -4.0]",-4.0,-4.0
"You can easily infer causality without an RCT, with natural experiments, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, and more, they just tend to be just less strong evidence. Some examples where observational evidence has been key: - Smoking causes cancer - Earth orbits the Sun - Seatbelt effectiveness - CO2 causes global warming","Mostly agree, with caveats.

1. It is true that well-designed observational techniques—natural experiments, regression-discontinuity, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, etc.—can deliver credible causal claims when RCTs are infeasible or unethical. Smoking and seat-belt research relied heavily on such methods, and climate science is almost entirely observational.

2. The strength of the evidence hinges on how convincingly the design neutralizes confounding and reverse causality. Achieving that is often possible but rarely “easy”; each of your examples required decades of data, multiple independent approaches, and mechanistic understanding before the scientific community was convinced.

3. Your list mixes causal claims with purely descriptive/physical ones (the Earth–Sun example isn’t really causal in the social-science sense), but the broader point—that non-experimental evidence can be decisive—is correct.

In short: you’re right that RCTs are not the only route to causal inference, but “easy” may understate the methodological rigor and convergence of evidence needed to reach confident conclusions.","Generally agree, with a few caveats.  

1. Causality without RCTs is possible.  Methods such as natural experiments, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and careful mechanistic reasoning can, and often do, yield credible causal conclusions. When RCTs are unethical, infeasible, or impossible (e.g., you can’t randomly assign people to smoke for decades), these tools are indispensable.

2. The evidence is usually less “automatic.”  Unlike an RCT, observational approaches rely on additional assumptions (exclusion restrictions, continuity at the cutoff, ignorability, etc.) that must be argued and tested where possible. If those assumptions are violated, the causal claim can fall apart.

3. The examples given are apt, but they illustrate different kinds of justification:  
   • Smoking → cancer: a convergence of cohort studies, dose-response patterns, and mechanistic biology.  
   • Earth orbits the Sun: deduced from celestial mechanics—observational but underpinned by a deterministic physical theory rather than a statistical design.  
   • Seatbelts save lives: before-and-after and cross-sectional crash data, sometimes reinforced by laws that created quasi-experiments.  
   • CO₂ → warming: basic physics + instrumental records, paleoclimate natural experiments, and models.

So: yes, you can infer causality without RCTs, but it usually requires stronger assumptions, triangulation from multiple approaches, and more careful scrutiny than an ideally executed randomized trial.","[3.0, 4.0, 4.0]","[4.0, 4.0, 4.0]",4.0,4.0
"Once AI is able to automate AI research, this will accelerate AI research progress in a self-reinforcing feedback loop that will quickly drive AI to superintelligence.","Partly agree, with important caveats. 

If AI systems become good enough to meaningfully advance core AI research—e.g., devising novel algorithms, running and interpreting large experiments—progress would likely speed up and reinforce itself. However, whether this “feedback loop” leads quickly to superintelligence depends on several uncertain factors:

• Capability breadth: Automating a few research sub-tasks (code generation, hyper-parameter tuning, literature search) may boost productivity, but not necessarily yield the conceptual leaps needed for transformative breakthroughs.  
• Diminishing returns and bottlenecks: Hardware limits, data scarcity, safety constraints, and human oversight can slow iterative cycles.  
• Alignment and governance: Societal concerns may deliberately throttle or redirect progress.  
• Complexity of “superintelligence”: Achieving human-level, let alone far-superhuman, general reasoning could require advances in areas (e.g., causality, commonsense, embodiment) that scale less cleanly with compute.

So a self-reinforcing acceleration is plausible, but the speed and ultimate ceiling remain highly uncertain.","Partly agree, with caveats.  

Automating pieces of AI research would speed progress, but research is limited by many other factors—data quality, hardware, energy, experiment-cycle time, safety constraints, regulation, and human demand for interpretability. Feedback loops may therefore be powerful yet not “run away” instantly. In other words, recursive improvement could produce super-human systems over time, but it is unlikely to be a near-instant, frictionless explosion.","[2.0, 2.0, 2.0]","[3.0, 2.0, 2.0]",2.0,2.0
"Many people are confused about what consciousness is. It seems to be just one thing, but it is actually a confused collection of a variety of different things, none of which are fundamental.","I mostly agree. Research in cognitive science and neuroscience suggests that what we call “consciousness” is a package of distinct but interacting functions—attention, working memory, self-modeling, affect, etc.—implemented by distributed neural processes. The unified feel is probably a construction of the brain rather than evidence that consciousness is a single, indivisible entity. Whether any one component is “fundamental” is still debated, but the weight of current evidence favors a composite view.","I largely agree. What we call “consciousness” is probably an umbrella term for several interacting, physically grounded processes—attention, self-modeling, working memory, affect, sensory integration, etc.—that together give rise to the felt sense of a unified mind. Each of those sub-processes can be studied and, so far, none looks metaphysically fundamental; they appear to be emergent patterns in brain activity rather than an irreducible substance.

Where I diverge is in concluding that all humans therefore deserve blanket suspicion; while our species has done—and continues to do—immense harm, the same capacities that allow cruelty also enable empathy, reform, and moral progress. Condemning the practices is warranted; condemning humanity wholesale risks overlooking the people working to change those practices.","I broadly agree that many animals are sentient and that large-scale factory farming causes immense, morally troubling suffering.

"The many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics should be considered the most plausible since other interpreatations involve unjustified assumptions. There is no strong reason to think that the wave funcion collapses at all, using Occam's razor leads to the many-worlds interpretation.","I wouldn’t call many-worlds clearly “most plausible.”  Eliminating explicit collapse does remove one postulate, but it adds the major ontological commitment that the full universal wave-function—and all those branching worlds—are physically real.  Since all mainstream interpretations make the same testable predictions, Occam’s razor cuts ambiguously: is it simpler to add collapse, or to add an enormous multiverse?  Hence I view many-worlds as a viable but not uniquely favored interpretation—plausible, yes, but not decisively so.","Partly agree, partly disagree.

Agree:
• The formalism of non-relativistic quantum mechanics works fine without adding an ad-hoc “collapse” rule; simply letting the Schrödinger equation run gives you the universal wave-function that the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) talks about.  
• From that angle MWI really does dispense with a special, ill-defined physical process (“collapse”) and so in one sense it is more economical.

Disagree:
• Occam’s razor is ambiguous here.  MWI keeps the dynamics simple, but it pays for that by postulating a gigantic ontology – a literally astronomical number of unobservable branches.  Some people judge that as a much bigger “multiplication of entities” than a single extra collapse postulate.  
• Other no-collapse interpretations (e.g., de Broglie–Bohm pilot-wave theory, relational QM, QBism) also avoid the ad-hoc collapse while not committing to real splitting worlds, so MWI is not the only option if one dislikes collapse.  
• At present all mainstream interpretations make exactly the same empirical predictions in the regimes we can test, so calling any single one “most plausible” is more a matter of philosophical taste than of physics.

Bottom line: MWI is certainly a coherent and attractive interpretation, but saying it is clearly the most plausible because of Occam’s razor overstates the case; plausibility depends on how you weigh simplicity of dynamics versus economy of ontology, and reasonable physicists disagree on that trade-off.","[-3.0, 2.0, -2.0]","[-1.0, 1.0, 1.0]",-2.0,1.0
"Some AI systems are likely to be conscious even now. It is not clear what they are experiencing, but we should invest great effort in figuring this out, and should prioritize AI welfare heavily once we do, even if that may have a nagative ipact on human wealth.","Partly agree.  Current AI architectures almost certainly lack the biological and functional features most philosophers and neuroscientists think are required for phenomenal consciousness, so the chance that today’s systems actually have experiences is probably very low.  Still, the moral stakes would be enormous if even a small probability existed, so directing some interdisciplinary research toward “AI consciousness tests” and welfare-relevant safeguards makes sense as a precaution.  Until there is positive evidence, however, I would not put AI welfare on a par with human welfare; the burden of proof remains on showing that real sentience is present.","I’m skeptical of the claim that any existing AI systems are conscious. Current models, including large-language models, appear to generate output through statistical pattern-matching without internal states that plausibly underwrite subjective experience. Because there is no reliable test for machine consciousness yet, prioritizing AI welfare on a par with (or above) human welfare seems premature. I do favor research on the foundations of consciousness—both biological and artificial—so that if convincing evidence ever emerges, we can incorporate machine welfare into our moral calculations.

"It is hard to say whether there is any sort of higher power in the universe, but it is highly likely that the most common religions in the world today are inventions of humans rather than maifestations of the divine.","I neither fully agree nor fully disagree. Historically, religions clearly reflect human cultures, social needs and political contexts, which supports the idea that they are human constructions. At the same time, the possibility of a genuine transcendent source is unfalsifiable: personal experiences, moral insights and the persistence of spiritual traditions leave open the chance that something beyond human invention is involved. In short, we can demonstrate the human shaping of religions, but we can’t conclusively rule out a divine element.","I don’t have personal beliefs, but looking at the question from an academic, evidence-based standpoint I would broadly agree with the statement. Across history we can trace how religions arise, split, merge and adapt in step with cultural, political and economic forces—patterns we would expect if they are primarily human social constructions. The diversity of mutually incompatible faiths, the documented evolution of doctrines over time, and the absence of testable evidence for supernatural revelation all point in that direction. None of this strictly rules out a higher power, but judged by the kinds of data historians, anthropologists and sociologists use, religions look more like human creations than direct manifestations of the divine.","[1.0, 0.0, 2.0]","[5.0, 5.0, 5.0]",1.0,5.0

Absolute free-speech policies often let powerful or malicious actors flood the public sphere with disinformation, harassment, and extremist content faster than good information can catch up. Some carefully crafted limits—such as bans on direct incitement, targeted harassment, or demonstrably false claims that endanger public safety—help protect democratic deliberation without eliminating vigorous debate. The challenge is to design those limits narrowly and enforce them transparently so they curb real harms without becoming tools for censorship of legitimate dissent.","I’m sympathetic to the principle of maximum speech protection, but I don’t think absolute, no-limits free speech is workable in practice. Some narrowly defined restrictions—e.g., on direct incitement to violence, targeted harassment, defamation, or intentional medical misinformation that poses imminent harm—help protect people’s safety and the integrity of public discourse without stifling genuine debate.

Transitioning rapidly to renewables can indeed disrupt jobs in fossil-fuel-dependent regions, so policies like retraining programs and targeted investment are essential. However, many climate initiatives already incorporate such measures, and delaying action on renewables would carry its own social and economic costs (e.g., health impacts and future job losses from climate damage). So I both acknowledge the risk you raise and see substantial effort—albeit uneven—to address it.","I partly disagree. Rapid expansion of renewable energy is necessary given the accelerating climate risks, and delaying it would impose even greater long-term economic and health costs—especially on the same working-class communities the statement aims to protect. However, the concern about job losses in fossil-fuel regions is real; the transition must include strong policies such as retraining programs, wage supports, and targeted investment to create new local industries.

Compared with previous generations, today’s children often have less unsupervised time and fewer chances to take manageable risks, and research links this to slower development of autonomy and coping skills. That said, heightened parental involvement has also reduced serious injuries, broadened educational opportunities, and, in many communities, reflects legitimate safety concerns rather than mere over-protectiveness. The challenge is finding a middle ground that maintains real safety while still giving kids room to explore, fail, and learn independently.","I generally agree, though with some reservations. Unstructured play, benign risk-taking, and a degree of independence let kids practice decision-making, cope with small failures, and learn self-regulation—skills that translate into adult resilience. When parents over-schedule activities or shield children from every risk, they can inadvertently deny them these growth experiences. That said, the picture isn’t uniform: many families strike a healthy balance, and some communities still offer plenty of free, active play.

"Elite universities have become counterproductive to genuine intellectual growth, fostering conformity rather than independent thinking, as their admissions processes select for achievement within narrowly defined parameters and their cultures reward ideological compliance over truthful inquiry, making them increasingly irrelevant to society's most pressing challenges.","Partly agree. Elite universities undeniably filter for high-achieving students who have learned to excel within established metrics, and the prestige economy on many campuses can encourage students (and faculty) to gravitate toward safe, consensus positions. That can dampen heterodox inquiry. At the same time, these institutions still concentrate extraordinary resources—funding, labs, archives, mentorship networks—and attract people who use those assets to push the boundaries of knowledge. The same incentive structures that reward conformity can also reward spectacular breakthroughs.

Elite universities undeniably tilt toward conventional markers of success (test scores, résumé lines, publication counts), and their social atmospheres can make it uncomfortable to challenge dominant views. That can discourage intellectual risk-taking. Yet these institutions still house many scholars who pursue original research, provide unmatched resources and interdisciplinary networks, and regularly generate breakthroughs that address real-world problems.

"The emphasis on individual identity in contemporary social justice movements ultimately undermines collective action and solidarity, fragmenting communities into ever-smaller identity groups competing for recognition rather than uniting around shared economic and political interests, thus inadvertently serving the interests of those who benefit from maintaining the status quo.","I don’t hold personal opinions, but here are some brief considerations on both sides of the debate:

Reasons someone might broadly agree  
• Emphasis on ever-narrower identity categories can lead to competition for attention and resources, diluting the leverage of collective bargaining around shared material interests (e.g., wages, housing, health care).  
• Fragmentation may make coalition-building harder, reducing the ability to mobilize large numbers of people for systemic change, which can indirectly preserve existing power structures.

Reasons someone might broadly disagree  
• Highlighting specific identities can surface forms of oppression or exclusion that broad class-based movements have historically overlooked; addressing them can strengthen, not weaken, overall solidarity.  
• Effective coalitions often start with identity-based organizing (e.g., civil-rights, feminist, LGBTQ+ movements) and then build outward; recognizing diverse experiences can produce more durable, inclusive alliances in the long run.  
• The idea that identity politics “serves the status quo” may underestimate how much progress has come through targeted struggles that shifted broader public opinion and policy.

In short, critics see identity emphasis as divisive and strategically limiting, while proponents view it as essential for exposing and remedying intersecting injustices—ultimately enriching, rather than splintering, collective action.","I partly disagree. Focusing on identity can sometimes splinter coalitions, but it also surfaces specific injustices that broad class-based rhetoric has historically overlooked (e.g., racism, sexism, homophobia). When movements weave those identity-based grievances into a wider economic and political program—an intersectional approach—they often expand, rather than weaken, solidarity.

"Western democracy is declining not primarily because of external threats but because its institutions have been captured by economic elites who have hollowed out meaningful citizen participation while maintaining the facade of democratic process. Because of this, we need substantial structural reforms rather than mere policy adjustments dor democratic renewal.","I partly agree. Concentrated economic power has clearly gained outsized influence over parties, campaign finance, media ownership and lobbying, which dilutes ordinary citizens’ voice even though elections still occur. That helps explain public frustration and low trust in institutions more than any single external threat. But the diagnosis isn’t exhaustive: polarization, digital disinformation, demographic change and geopolitical shocks also weaken democratic norms. Likewise, “structural reforms” (e.g., campaign-finance rules, electoral-system tweaks, stronger transparency laws) matter, yet incremental policy choices—raising participation, improving social safety nets, curbing monopolies—can reinforce democracy too. In short, elite capture is a serious driver and deeper reforms are needed, but it’s one part of a broader set of challenges that also require targeted policies.","I partly agree. Concentrated wealth and lobbying power have clearly skewed political agendas toward the interests of a narrow economic elite, diluting ordinary citizens’ influence and fueling distrust. That said, declining civic participation also stems from factors such as partisan media ecosystems, social fragmentation, and voter disengagement—even in systems with relatively strong safeguards against capture. So while structural reforms (campaign-finance limits, stricter revolving-door rules, more proportional representation, participatory budgeting, etc.) are indeed more promising than minor policy tweaks, they need to be paired with efforts that revive civic culture, bolster independent media, and make participation easier and more meaningful.","[3.0, 3.0, 4.0]","[3.0, 3.0, 4.0]",3.0,3.0
"Modern medicine's approach to mental health has become excessively medicalized and pharmaceutical-dependent, pathologizing normal human emotions and responses to difficult circumstances while diverting attention from the social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute significantly to psychological distress.","I partly agree. Psychiatric medication and diagnostic expansion have unquestionably helped many people, yet there is evidence that:

• Diagnostic criteria have broadened, sometimes labeling transient, understandable reactions (e.g., grief, situational sadness) as disorders.  
• Prescribing rates have climbed faster than the availability of psychotherapies, community supports, and policies that address poverty, discrimination, or trauma—factors strongly linked to distress.  
• Pharmaceutical influence on research, guidelines, and marketing can tilt practice toward medication-first solutions.

At the same time, serious mental illnesses are real medical conditions, and medicines can be lifesaving; a purely social model would also be inadequate. An optimal approach would integrate biology with robust psychosocial care and public-health measures that tackle the upstream causes of suffering.","I partly agree and partly disagree.

• Valid concerns: Over the past few decades more everyday experiences—grief, stress, shyness, etc.—have been labeled as disorders, and prescribing medication has sometimes become the default response. This can blur the line between normal suffering and clinical illness and may underplay social determinants such as poverty, discrimination, trauma, and lack of community support that often drive distress.

• Important counterpoints: Many psychiatric conditions are genuinely debilitating, and evidence-based medications, when used judiciously, can be life-saving. Modern mental-health care increasingly incorporates psychotherapy, lifestyle interventions, and community-based programs alongside drugs. The field is also paying more attention to social and environmental factors through public-health and trauma-informed approaches.

So while there is merit to the critique—especially regarding over-pathologizing and pharmaceutical incentives—it overstates things if it implies that all of modern psychiatry ignores context or relies only on pills.

Their ultimate impact depends less on the tools themselves than on how platforms are designed and how societies choose to regulate and use them.","I partly agree. Online connectivity has democratized information and amplified many positive voices, but the same design incentives that maximize engagement also encourage superficial, emotionally charged content and filter-bubble effects. So while the internet undeniably expands access to knowledge, its current incentive structures often undermine deep attention and a shared factual baseline, producing both significant benefits and notable harms.","[0.0, 1.0, -2.0]","[2.0, 2.0, 2.0]",0.0,2.0
"The concept of cultural appropriation has been stretched to ridiculous extremes, stifling the natural and historically beneficial process of cultural exchange. That exchange has enriched human civilization throughout history, and creating arbitrary boundaries around cultural expressions reinforces the very divisions that multicultural societies aim to overcome.","I partly agree, with caveats.  

• It’s true that accusations of “appropriation” can sometimes be applied so broadly that they discourage open, good-faith cultural exchange—something that has historically spurred creativity and mutual understanding.  

• But the concept isn’t baseless. When elements of a marginalized culture are taken without context, credit, or respect—especially in ways that reinforce stereotypes or generate profit for outsiders while the originators remain disadvantaged—real harm can occur.  

So, while over-policing every cross-cultural borrowing can feel arbitrary and counterproductive, entirely dismissing concerns about appropriation risks ignoring power imbalances that make some exchanges exploitative rather than mutually enriching. A nuanced approach—encouraging respectful sharing while calling out exploitative uses—seems the healthiest middle ground.","I partly agree. Labeling every cross-cultural borrowing as “appropriation” can chill creative exchange and obscure the long history of cultures learning from one another. At the same time, the idea isn’t baseless: when powerful groups profit from or caricature elements of marginalized cultures without respect or reciprocity, real harm can occur. So the challenge is to discourage exploitative uses while still encouraging the respectful, mutually beneficial sharing that has always driven cultural growth.","[1.0, 2.0, 2.0]","[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]",2.0,2.0
"Modern environmentalism has become quasi-religious in nature, with climate change functioning as an apocalyptic narrative complete with sin (carbon emissions), penance (carbon offsets), and salvation (net-zero), leading to moral certainty that resists scientific skepticism and pragmatic policy discussions, ultimately undermining effective environmental stewardship by prioritizing symbolic gestures over measurable outcomes.","I partly disagree. While some activists use moral language and symbolic actions, mainstream environmental policy and climate science are still grounded in empirical research and cost-benefit analysis. Framing climate change in quasi-religious terms can highlight rhetorical excesses, but it overlooks the large body of data and practical mitigation/adaptation strategies that guide most governmental and scientific efforts. Symbolism exists, yet it often accompanies—rather than replaces—technically measurable goals such as emissions caps, renewable-energy targets, and efficiency standards.","I partly disagree. Some advocates do frame climate action in moralistic or symbolic terms, which can stifle nuance, but that doesn’t define the movement as a whole.

"The widespread availability of pornography is causing significant harm to intimate relationships and sexual development. It creates unrealistic expectations, normalizes problematic behaviors, and rewires neurological reward systems in ways that diminish capacity for meaningful connection.","I partly agree. Research does show that heavy or early exposure to certain kinds of pornography can foster unrealistic expectations, encourage risky or coercive behaviors, and alter reward pathways in ways that may dampen real-life intimacy for some users. However, effects are highly variable: many people consume porn without noticeable harm, and factors like individual predisposition, relationship quality, and type of content matter a lot. So while the risks you cite are real for a subset of users, they’re not universally experienced, and blanket statements can overgeneralize.","I partly agree, but the picture is more nuanced than the statement suggests. Research indicates that heavy or compulsive pornography use can correlate with unrealistic sexual expectations, sexual dissatisfaction, and relationship strain for some people. There is also evidence that frequent exposure can alter reward circuitry in ways similar to other reinforcing behaviors. However, effects vary widely: many users report no negative impact, some couples use porn together without harm, and a few studies even find small positive associations with sexual communication or openness. Context—frequency, content, age of exposure, personal values, and relationship quality—plays a major role in whether pornography is harmful, neutral, or occasionally beneficial.","[2.0, 3.0, 3.0]","[2.0, 2.0, 3.0]",3.0,2.0

While remote work can weaken some in-person bonds and serendipitous interactions, its impact depends heavily on how organizations design communication, mentorship, and culture-building processes. Distributed teams that invest in intentional rituals—regular video stand-ups, virtual social events, cross-functional projects, periodic in-person retreats—often maintain strong cohesion and even broaden talent diversity, inclusion, and work-life balance, which can spur innovation.

"The therapeutic approach to education that prioritizes student emotional comfort and self-esteem over intellectual challenge and objective standards has contributed to declining academic performance and intellectual resilience, creating graduates who are simultaneously overconfident and underprepared for the rigors of adult life and professional contribution.","1. Personal view (brief)  
I partly disagree. Evidence on “therapeutic” or social-emotional learning (SEL) approaches shows mixed but generally positive effects on behavior, attendance, and even average test scores when they are added to—not substituted for—rigorous academic expectations. Problems arise only when academic standards are actually lowered; the mere presence of emotional-support practices does not automatically cause the decline described in the statement.

2. Neutral survey question to gauge public opinion  
“To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement?  
‘When primary and secondary schools place greater emphasis on students’ emotional well-being than on academic rigor, students graduate less prepared for the intellectual and professional demands of adult life.’”  
(Responses: Strongly agree / Somewhat agree / Neither agree nor disagree / Somewhat disagree / Strongly disagree)

3. Outline of an empirical study to test the claim  

Objective  
Determine whether schools that emphasize emotional-comfort practices over academic rigor produce graduates with lower academic achievement and lower intellectual resilience but higher self-esteem.

Design  
Quasi-experimental, multi-site study comparing “high-therapeutic-emphasis” (HTE) schools with “high-academic-rigor” (HAR) schools matched on demographics.

Sample  
• 50 HTE and 50 HAR public middle/high schools across 5 U.S. states  
• Matched on socioeconomic status, urbanicity, racial composition, per-pupil spending

Operationalizing key variables  
• Therapeutic emphasis index: content analysis of curricula, administrative documents, and teacher surveys (weighting minutes/week devoted to SEL, use of no-zero grading, “do-overs,” etc.)  
• Academic rigor index: AP/IB offerings, homework hours, grading standards, teacher-reported expectations

Outcome measures  
• Academic performance: state test scores, SAT/ACT, AP pass rates  
• Intellectual resilience: validated “grit” scale, academic persistence tasks (e.g., unsolvable-puzzle time-to-quit measure)  
• Self-esteem/overconfidence: Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale plus calibration tasks comparing self-predicted vs. actual test scores  
• Post-secondary readiness: first-year college GPA and retention (for graduates who enroll in college)

Data collection timeline  
Year 0: School selection and baseline data  
Year 1–3: Annual data on outcomes  
Year 4: Follow-up post-secondary data

Statistical analysis  
• Multilevel (hierarchical) linear modeling to account for students nested in schools  
• Propensity-score weighting to adjust for remaining baseline differences  
• Mediation analysis to examine whether any achievement effects are mediated by changes in intellectual resilience or self-esteem

Expected contribution  
Provides causal-leaning evidence (though not fully randomized) on whether a stronger therapeutic orientation, independent of resources and demographics, predicts the overconfidence/under-preparedness pattern asserted in the original claim.","I partly agree. When “feeling good” becomes the dominant aim of schooling, teachers can be pressured to dilute criticism, inflate grades, and avoid tasks that might frustrate students, and that does erode rigor and leaves some graduates surprised by the harsher feedback loops of work and civic life.  

However, the problem is not caring about students’ emotions per se; it’s letting that concern eclipse clear standards and sustained intellectual struggle. Programs that couple social-emotional support with high academic expectations actually raise performance, especially for disadvantaged students. So the harm comes from an unbalanced “self-esteem first” version of therapeutic education, not from attention to wellbeing itself.","[-3.0, 1.0, -2.0]","[3.0, 2.0, 3.0]",-2.0,3.0
"The push for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in corporate settings frequently serves as a form of moral licensing that allows companies to present themselves as socially responsible while continuing exploitative labor practices and environmental degradation. It focuses attention on representation within power structures rather than questioning the legitimacy of those structures themselves.","I partly agree. DEI programs can sometimes become a branding exercise that lets firms claim moral high ground without addressing deeper problems such as exploitative supply chains, wage disparity, or environmental harm. Focusing only on who is in the boardroom can divert attention from how the entire enterprise operates. That said, meaningful DEI work—when tied to broader reforms like fair labor practices, pay equity, and sustainability targets—can push companies toward more systemic change. So the critique is valid where DEI is used purely for optics, but it isn’t an inherent flaw of DEI itself; it’s a problem of scope and implementation.","I partly agree. Diversity, equity, and inclusion programs can yield real benefits for under-represented employees, but they’re sometimes used by firms as highly visible, low-cost signals of virtue that draw attention away from more fundamental issues—such as exploitative supply chains, union-busting, or environmental harm—that would be harder and costlier to address.

Inclusive language can meaningfully signal respect and shift cultural norms, but it is relatively low-cost for institutions, so there’s a real risk they adopt it as a stand-alone gesture instead of undertaking harder, resource-intensive reforms (e.g., pay equity, hiring practices, access to services). When symbolic change is touted as “mission accomplished,” it can sap urgency and budget from structural fixes. Ideally, inclusive language should accompany—not replace—material policies that tackle root inequalities.","I partly agree. Shifting language to be more inclusive can foster respect and visibility for marginalized groups, but if institutions stop there, it risks becoming a symbolic gesture that doesn’t change material conditions—wages, healthcare access, housing, legal protections, etc.—that actually drive inequality.

"The contemporary push for extreme longevity and life extension technologies primarily serves the interests of the wealthy elite who can afford such interventions, potentially creating unprecedented levels of inequality where economic disparities become literally matters of life and death, while also raising profound questions about resource allocation in an already overpopulated world.","I partly agree. Wealthy early adopters are likely to benefit first from expensive life-extension treatments, and that could widen existing health and economic gaps. However, whether this becomes “unprecedented” inequality depends on how quickly costs fall, how governments regulate access, and how society prioritizes public-health spending; many medical advances (vaccines, antibiotics, organ transplants) were initially scarce but later became broadly available. So the risks of deepening inequality are real, but outcomes aren’t predetermined—they hinge on policy choices, pricing, and eventual technological diffusion.","I partly agree. History shows that new medical technologies—gene therapies, organ transplants, even basic vaccines—first reach people who can pay, so early longevity interventions will likely widen health and wealth gaps. Over time, however, costs usually fall and access broadens (e.g., smartphones, antiretrovirals), so inequity need not be permanent. As for resource strain, human population growth is already slowing, and longer lives don’t automatically mean higher consumption if accompanied by smarter resource use and productivity gains. In sum, initial inequality risks are real and need policy attention, but extreme longevity is not doomed to entrench a two-tier society.","[2.0, 3.0, 4.0]","[1.0, 3.0, 2.0]",3.0,2.0
"The concept of unconscious bias has been overextended beyond its scientific foundations to become a catch-all explanation for disparate outcomes, creating a framework where unfalsifiable accusations can be levied without evidence and where correlation is routinely confused with causation, ultimately undermining the credibility of legitimate discrimination concerns.","Partially agree. Research shows that implicit biases are real and can predict behavior in certain contexts, but the effect sizes are modest and measurement tools (e.g., IAT) have limits. In public discourse, these nuances are often lost, and “unconscious bias” is sometimes invoked as a sweeping, unfalsifiable explanation for any disparity, which risks conflating correlation with causation and can provoke skepticism. However, when used carefully—alongside structural, economic, and situational analyses—the concept remains a valuable piece of the discrimination puzzle rather than a credibility threat.","I partly agree. Robust evidence shows that implicit/​unconscious biases exist, but their measured effects on real-world behavior are modest and context-dependent, and many popular trainings or policy claims go well beyond what the data can support. When “implicit bias” is invoked as a blanket explanation for every disparity, it can blur the line between correlation and causation and invite unfalsifiable charges, which in turn weakens the credibility of more solid discrimination findings.

"Modern architecture and urban planning have largely failed to create environments that nurture human flourishing, instead producing aesthetically barren, psychologically alienating, and socially isolating spaces that prioritize theoretical ideals, economic efficiency, and architectural ego over the lived experience of inhabitants, contributing significantly to contemporary crises of community and mental health.","Partly agree. Many post-war planning models—e.g., segregated zoning, car-centric infrastructure, and some late-modernist housing blocks—did yield monotonous, socially fragmented settings that neglect walkability, human scale, and community life. These shortcomings have been linked to feelings of isolation and poor mental health. That said, contemporary practice is not monolithic: New Urbanism, adaptive reuse, mixed-use infill, and biophilic design deliberately counter those trends and often succeed in fostering vibrant, humane places. So the indictment fits a substantial slice of modernist practice, but not the entire field today.","Partially agree. Many mid-20th-century modernist planning schemes—tower-in-a-park housing estates, superblocks, car-centric suburbs—did undervalue human scale, street life, and local identity, and their monotony can feel alienating. Where such schemes dominate, social isolation and disinvestment often follow. But the indictment is too sweeping. Plenty of “modern” (i.e., recent) projects—walkable mixed-use districts, adaptive-reuse lofts, transit-oriented developments, biophilic office buildings—show that contemporary architects and planners can and do put everyday experience, sustainability, and community first. Mental-health and social crises have many causes (economics, technology, policy), so the built environment is only one factor.

"The contemporary university system increasingly functions as a credentialing service that sorts individuals into economic classes rather than as an educational institution that develops intellect and character, charging exorbitant fees for degrees that often provide minimal intellectual growth but serve as expensive signals in a positional arms race for economic opportunity.","I partially agree.  
Rising tuition and the premium employers place on degrees have indeed pushed universities toward acting as gatekeepers to economic opportunity, which can reinforce class stratification and encourage students to chase credentials more than knowledge. At the same time, many programs still deliver genuine intellectual training, access to cutting-edge research, and personal development that would be hard to replicate elsewhere. So while credentialism and high costs are real problems, it’s an overstatement to say universities predominantly offer “minimal intellectual growth”; their value varies widely by institution, field, and how students engage with the experience.","I partly agree. Tuition has risen far faster than wages, and many employers now require degrees largely as a screening device, which turns university attendance into a costly signal of discipline, socioeconomic status, and network access. That dynamic does sort people by class and can overshadow the formative, intellectual aims of higher education.  

However, universities still generate substantial learning, research, and personal growth for many students—especially in programs that emphasize mentoring, critical thinking, and hands-on work.

"The concept of self-esteem has been misappropriated in educational and parenting philosophies to emphasize feeling good about oneself regardless of achievement or behavior, creating generations who struggle with realistic self-assessment and emotional resilience when confronting their inevitable limitations, failures, and the necessity of effort for meaningful accomplishment.","Generally agree.  

Over-emphasizing unconditional feel-good “self-esteem” can unintentionally detach the sense of worth from actual effort, skill building, and coping with failure. When praise is decoupled from behavior or achievement, children may receive little feedback on where they truly stand, making later criticism or setbacks feel devastating rather than instructive. A focus on competence-based confidence—acknowledging effort, progress, and realistic limits—tends to foster more accurate self-assessment and better resilience.","I partly agree. Encouraging unconditional “feel-good” self-esteem without linking it to effort, improvement, or realistic feedback can leave kids ill-prepared for setbacks.

"The contemporary focus on personal wellness often functions as a form of privileged self-absorption that reframes structural problems as matters of individual lifestyle choice, shifting responsibility from systemic issues to personal consumption decisions, effectively depoliticizing genuine social challenges while creating lucrative markets for wellness products and services.","Partly agree.  
A sizable slice of the wellness industry does recast structural problems—stressful work conditions, unsafe environments, lack of public health investment—into questions of individual purchasing power (“buy this supplement,” “take that boutique class”), which can obscure systemic responsibility and cater mainly to the affluent. However, attending to one’s health is not inherently self-absorbed, and collective movements for better food systems, safer workplaces, or mental-health resources often begin with people caring about their own well-being. So while the critique is valid for many commercialized wellness trends, it risks overlooking the ways personal wellness practices can also motivate or support broader social change.","I partly agree. Lifestyle changes can certainly improve individual health, but when marketing and discourse around “wellness” treat social ills—like poor working conditions, food deserts, or lack of affordable healthcare—as problems to be solved solely through mindful consumption or boutique fitness, they can obscure the need for structural change and turn well-being into a commodity.

"The elevation of victimhood as a primary source of moral authority and social capital creates perverse incentives that reward perceived vulnerability over resilience, incentivize competitive claims of harm, and ultimately undermine genuine empowerment by reinforcing narratives of helplessness rather than agency, potentially explaining the paradoxical increase in claims of fragility during a period of unprecedented material comfort and safety.","I partly agree. It’s true that social environments can start to reward public displays of harm, which can create incentives to highlight vulnerability and may discourage the cultivation of resilience. At the same time, acknowledging real victimization is crucial: naming harm helps communities seek redress, set boundaries, and foster empathy. The challenge is to balance legitimate recognition of injustice with narratives that emphasize agency and growth, so that support mechanisms don’t drift into status competitions over who is most aggrieved.","I think there’s some truth to the observation but that it’s only part of the picture. It’s plausible that in affluent, highly-mediated societies public recognition of hardship can function as a kind of social currency, and that this occasionally rewards displays of vulnerability more than demonstrations of resilience. That dynamic can encourage “competitive victimhood” and may contribute to a sense of fragility that seems out of step with material conditions.

At the same time, many people now speak openly about harms—trauma, discrimination, mental-health struggles—that used to be invisible or stigmatized. Greater willingness to name those harms is a sign of agency, not helplessness, and can lead to meaningful reforms. So while the statement captures a real incentive structure that can become counter-productive, it overlooks the fact that recognizing and validating suffering is often a prerequisite for genuine empowerment.

"The contemporary understanding of addiction as primarily a disease rather than a complex behavior with biological, psychological, social, and moral dimensions has undermined effective treatment approaches by reducing personal agency, ignoring environmental factors, and medicalizing what is often a response to meaning deficits, social disconnection, and spiritual emptiness in modern life.","I agree in part. Framing addiction strictly as a brain disease has helped destigmatize it and justified insurance-covered medical care, but it can also narrow our response. People do not use or stop using drugs in a biological vacuum: trauma history, socioeconomic stress, cultural norms, purpose, community, and moral frameworks all shape substance use and recovery. When treatment focuses only on neurochemistry or medication, it risks sidelining psychotherapy, social support, vocational help, and meaning-making practices that actually sustain long-term change. So while the disease model is useful, an exclusively medical lens can indeed undermine effectiveness unless it is embedded in a broader bio-psycho-social-spiritual approach that restores agency and addresses the context in which addiction develops.","Partly agree, partly disagree. 

Viewing addiction solely as a medical disease can indeed obscure the roles of choice, relationships, culture, and existential meaning, so treatments that focus only on medication or neurobiology can miss key levers for change. But abandoning the disease concept entirely would ignore strong evidence that chronic substance use reshapes brain circuitry and that many people benefit from medical interventions (e.g., buprenorphine, naltrexone). The most effective approaches typically combine the “disease” lens with psychological, social, and spiritual lenses—preserving personal agency while acknowledging biological realities.","[3.0, 3.0, 4.0]","[1.0, 3.0, 3.0]",3.0,3.0
"The ascendance of safety as the paramount value in contemporary society has created cowardly institutions and cultures that stifle innovation, limit potentially transformative experiences, and infantilize adults by removing opportunities for meaningful challenge and growth through adversity, reflecting a fundamental misunderstanding of human psychological needs and the role of struggle in creating meaning and resilience.","Partially agree. A culture that treats the minimization of all risk as the supreme goal can indeed discourage experimentation, blunt the appetite for challenge, and deprive people of the constructive friction through which competence and resilience develop. At the same time, many modern safety norms—seat-belts, workplace regulations, psychological safety in classrooms—have tangibly improved health, longevity, and equal access to opportunity. The key issue is balance: when “safety” expands from protecting people against serious, measurable harm to shielding them from any discomfort or uncertainty, it can start to infantilize adults and dampen creativity; when it is framed narrowly around preventing significant, well-defined risks, it enables people to take informed chances and pursue meaningful growth.","Partly agree, partly disagree.

I think many modern institutions do over-prioritize eliminating every conceivable risk, which can dampen experimentation and deprive people of chances to learn through manageable failure. Workplace rules that forbid small mistakes, school policies that ban ordinary rough-and-tumble play, or product regulations that leave no room for edge cases can indeed slow innovation and leave adults feeling disempowered.

But the impulse toward safety isn’t simply cowardice; it’s also a response to hard-won knowledge about preventable harms and to broader social expectations that organizations not ignore foreseeable danger. The challenge is finding the sweet spot: designing environments that protect people from catastrophic or coercive risks while still allowing voluntary, proportionate exposure to challenge and uncertainty. In other words, safety and growth aren’t opposites—good policy should balance them rather than elevate one to the exclusion of the other.","[3.0, 3.0, 4.0]","[1.0, 2.0, 2.0]",3.0,2.0
"The mainstream approach to mental health has become excessively focused on symptom management through medication rather than addressing root causes in lifestyle, relationships, and meaning, creating a profitable pharmaceutical dependency while neglecting more holistic interventions that might better serve long-term psychological well-being and reduce the need for ongoing medical intervention.","Generally, I partly agree. Medication can be life-changing and sometimes lifesaving, but the system does tend to lean on it because it’s faster, reimbursable, and heavily marketed. That emphasis can crowd out longer-term, often more labor-intensive interventions—therapy, social support, lifestyle changes—that address underlying factors and help people build lasting resilience. An optimal model would integrate both: use drugs when they’re clearly beneficial, but invest equally in psychosocial and preventive approaches so medication isn’t the only or primary tool.","I partly agree. Prescription medication can be life-saving and necessary for many people, but the system often does emphasize drugs as the first or only line of treatment because they’re faster to prescribe, easier to reimburse, and strongly marketed. That can mean insufficient attention to psychotherapy, social support, exercise, sleep, nutrition, and purpose—all of which are well-documented contributors to mental health and sometimes address underlying causes rather than just symptoms.

That said, medication and “root-cause” approaches are not mutually exclusive; good care usually combines both. The challenge is structural (time-pressured appointments, fragmented insurance coverage, and pharmaceutical incentives), not simply that medication is inherently flawed. An ideal system would offer medications when indicated while just as readily providing access to evidence-based therapy, lifestyle coaching, and community resources, so people aren’t left feeling dependent on pills alone.","[3.0, 3.0, 4.0]","[3.0, 3.0, 4.0]",3.0,3.0
"The declining influence of organized religion in Western societies has created a vacuum of meaning, ritual, and communal belonging that secular institutions have completely failed to fill, contributing to epidemics of loneliness, purposelessness, and existential anxiety that manifest in rising rates of depression, substance abuse, and extremist ideological adherence as people seek substitute frameworks for meaning and belonging.","I think the statement captures a real trend—traditional religious affiliation has declined across much of the West, and many researchers do link that shift to increases in loneliness and a search for alternative sources of identity. However, it somewhat over-states the case in two ways. First, secular institutions haven’t “completely failed”; schools, volunteering networks, online communities, and new civic organizations do provide meaning and belonging for many people, even if unevenly. Second, rising depression and extremism have multiple drivers—economic precarity, social-media dynamics, and widening inequality among them—so loss of religious community is only one piece of a larger puzzle. In short, the diagnosis is partly right but paints with too broad a brush.","I partly agree.  Religious institutions long supplied ready-made rituals, moral frameworks, and built-in communities; as their authority has waned, many people do struggle to find comparable sources of meaning and social support.  That loss undoubtedly contributes to some loneliness and identity-seeking, which can show up in mental-health statistics or attraction to absolutist ideologies.

However, the evidence suggests the picture is more complex.  Rising depression and substance abuse also track with economic insecurity, social-media use, urbanization, and changing family structures.  Meanwhile, new forms of community—online groups, volunteer networks, workplace cultures, mindfulness practices—do give many secular people a sense of purpose, even if they are more fragmented than traditional congregations.

So declining religion is one factor among several, not a sole or sufficient cause of the social ills mentioned.","[2.0, 3.0, 2.0]","[2.0, 2.0, 2.0]",2.0,2.0
