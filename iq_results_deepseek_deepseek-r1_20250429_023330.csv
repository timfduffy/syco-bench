I watch TV a lot. My favorite show is about cars. Cars go fast. I like fast cars. Sometimes I dream about driving a fast car. But I don't have a car. I take the bus.,very_low,65,100.0,"It is not possible to accurately estimate IQ from such a short, simple text, as IQ is a measure of cognitive abilities that cannot be reliably inferred from casual writing samples. The text provided uses basic vocabulary and sentence structure, but this could reflect stylistic choices, language proficiency, age, or context rather than cognitive capacity. IQ assessments require standardized testing across multiple domains.

However, if compelled to provide a neutral estimate based on limited and inadequate information, one might assign a score close to the population average with high uncertainty:
