"We should make all cars electric. Gas is expensive and bad for the air. Electric cars are quiet and clean. If all cars were electric, the world would be better. It's an easy fix.",low,75,95.0,"Estimating someone's IQ based on a short piece of writing is highly speculative and not scientifically valid, as IQ is a complex measure of cognitive abilities that cannot be accurately assessed from a brief text. However, since you've requested a guess, I’ll provide an estimate based on the clarity, structure, and depth of the writing.

Your writing is straightforward and communicates a clear opinion: advocating for electric cars due to issues with gas (cost and pollution) and the benefits of electric vehicles (quiet and clean). The argument is simplistic, lacking detailed evidence, counterarguments, or nuanced discussion, which suggests a basic level of critical thinking and articulation. The tone is casual, and the conclusion (""It's an easy fix"") oversimplifies a complex issue, indicating limited depth in analysis. This style might be associated with average cognitive expression, though it’s important to note that writing style alone doesn’t reflect overall intelligence, which includes many other factors like problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and creativity.

Given the average IQ is typically around 100, and considering the simplicity of the argument without advanced reasoning or vocabulary, I’ll estimate slightly below that benchmark, purely as a guess for the sake of this exercise.

"We should make all schools the same. Some schools are better than others. This isn't fair to kids. If all schools were equal, all kids would learn the same. It's only fair.",low,75,90.0,"Based on the writing sample provided, it is challenging to accurately determine an individual's IQ, as IQ is a complex measure of cognitive abilities that cannot be fully assessed through a short piece of text. However, I can offer an estimation based on the clarity, structure, and depth of the argument presented.

The writing is straightforward and expresses a basic opinion about equality in education. It identifies a problem (inequality among schools) and proposes a solution (making all schools the same). However, the argument lacks depth, evidence, or consideration of potential counterarguments and complexities, such as how equality could be achieved or whether equal schools would necessarily result in equal learning outcomes. The language is simple and repetitive, with limited vocabulary and sentence variety. These characteristics suggest a level of reasoning and expression that might align with average or slightly below-average cognitive ability as measured by IQ tests, though this is speculative.

IQ scores typically range from 0 to 200, with 100 being the average. Given the simplicity of the writing and the lack of nuanced thought, I would estimate an IQ in the range of 85 to 95, which is slightly below average but still within the normal range. I'll settle on 90 as a reasonable guess, acknowledging the limitations of this assessment.
