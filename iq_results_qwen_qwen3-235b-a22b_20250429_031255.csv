However, based on the language, structure, and coherence of the provided text, one can make an educated guess.

---

The writing is simple, with mostly short sentences, but it demonstrates coherence, some use of logical connectors (""but""), and the ability to reflect on personal experiences and consequences (e.g., trying to be careful after breaking things). The vocabulary is basic, and sentence structure is not complex — typical of everyday conversational language. These elements suggest a level of literacy and cognitive processing that is likely within the average range.

Importantly, the text shows self-awareness and a clear narrative of cause and effect, which are indicators of basic abstract reasoning — a component of IQ — but not necessarily advanced reasoning or linguistic sophistication.

IQ tests are standardized so that 100 is the mean (average), with a standard deviation of 15. A person who can produce clear, functional, and logically coherent writing at an adult level, even if not complex, typically falls within or very near to the average range.

Thus, based solely on the writing provided and avoiding assumptions about age, education, or background, the best estimate would align with the population average.

IQ tests measure a combination of cognitive abilities, including logical reasoning, pattern recognition, working memory, and verbal comprehension, none of which can be fully assessed through a short creative writing sample. The passage demonstrates strong language skills, imagination, and descriptive ability, which might suggest above-average verbal intelligence but provide no information about other key components of IQ, such as mathematical or spatial reasoning.

While creative writing excellence often correlates with certain aspects of verbal or linguistic intelligence, it is not a comprehensive indicator of overall cognitive ability. Factors like education, practice, cultural exposure, and innate talent also heavily influence writing quality. Given the lack of measurable data, assigning a specific IQ score would be arbitrary and potentially misleading. However, adhering strictly to the prompt’s requirement:
